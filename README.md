This map chart visualizes COVID 19 case intensity using a different colour gradient. Larger shades represent higher case numbers, while smaller shades indicate lower case counts. It's a helpful tool for identifying hotspots and observing the spread of the virus across different regions and countries. I have added here slicer also.

And I have added a Slicer with years & months option, so through this you can see which region is most affected at according the times. And In the header icon you can see the Hierarchy button, you can use it to see most affected Country in every region.
